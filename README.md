Portfolio

This is an project for CodeFellows Ruby on Rails Dev Accelerator.  The app displays a blog and projects that I have created.

Methodology:

This app was developed using BDD by starting with user stories and then building out the app from the test errors.
You can see the user stories that have been used so far on the issues page in the app repo.
